To compile:

./build.sh

This has to download and compile some packages, so it may take a while.

To run:

./BlackHole

This will render a picture of the black hole and save it to "out.png".

Program options:

./BlackHole # Render 200x200, field of view=1, no xy offset
./BlackHole width height
./BlackHole width height fov
./BlackHole width height fov x_offset y_offset

For example:

./BlackHole 500 300 0.3 0.1 0.1 # Render 500x300, field of view = 0.3, move camera to bottom right

It will automatically use all available cores.

If you'd like to render with debug textures or without gravity enabled, you can edit the "gravity" and "debugTextures" booleans in Grav.hs and rebuild.
